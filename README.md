## What is Filtrera?

Filtrera is a minimalistic functional programming language made to make it easy to create business-oriented
DSLs with a common, easy-to-learn syntax that is safe to run inside a host application.

The language is designed to be as barebone as possible, and relies on a powerful runtime concept that allows different hosts to extend the language with new functionality as needed. This makes Filtrera an exceptionally good embedded language for defining custom behavior and extending functionality of host applications.

The vanilla compiler avoids the halting problem by not providing recursion or conditional looping, while at
the same time allowing higher order functions. Loops and other powerful constructs can be added through
the runtime framework.

Filtrera is made by [Kristoffer Lindvall](https://github.com/kristofferlindvall).
