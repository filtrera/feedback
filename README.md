## What is Filtrera?

Filtrera is a new minimalistic functional language with a set of unusual features, such as not allowing recursion. The language is designed to be as barebone as possible, and relies on a powerful runtime concept that allows different hosts to extend the language with new functionality as needed. This makes Filtrera an exceptionally good embedded language for defining custom behavior and extending functionality of host applications.

It is designed to be:

- Easy to learn, even for non-programmers
- Safe to run

Filtrera is made by [Kristoffer Lindvall](https://github.com/kristofferlindvall).
